# DDoS-Attk-Detection-System-using-ML

The project is focused on implementing a machine learning model for predictive analytics. The project has 8 features that include data acquisition, data preprocessing, feature engineering, ML model building, training, testing, alert generation, and visualization.

## Features

The project has the following features:

1. Data Acquisition: This feature is used to gather data from various sources for further analysis. This can include reading data from files, APIs, databases, or any other source of data.

2. Data Preprocessing: This feature is used to clean and prepare the data for further analysis. This can include file conversion, label encoding, normalization, removing missing values from the dataset, etc.

3. Feature Engineering: This feature is used to extract and select relevant features from the dataset. This can include PCA, univariate feature selection, and recursive feature elimination.

4. ML Model Building: This feature is used to build a machine learning model using the processed data. The model can be built using various algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.

5. Training: This feature is used to train the machine learning model using the processed data. The model is trained using a subset of the data, and the remaining data is used for testing.

6. Testing: This feature is used to test the accuracy of the machine learning model. The testing data is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

7. Alert Generation: This feature is used to generate alerts based on the predictions of the machine learning model. The alerts can be sent to the relevant stakeholders.

8. Visualization: This feature is used to visualize the data and the predictions of the machine learning model. The data can be visualized using various techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, line graphs, etc.
